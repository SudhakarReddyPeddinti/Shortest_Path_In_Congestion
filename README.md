# Shortest_Path_In_Congestion
A novel approach for finding the shortest path in Congestion routes.   Algorithms like [Dijkstra's algorithm - Single source shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) and [Floyd Warshall - All pairs shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floydâ€“Warshall_algorithm) are designed and holds good for single entity travelling in the connected graphs. But in real life, this is not the case, As given in the project problem, there could be many other cars on the road who might share the same source and destination as you do and all of them are interested in shortest path. In this case, we need to consider the congestion created on the shortest paths and re-route the traffic accordingly.
